## Duplicate reply after an "ask_user" prompt in the CLI chat

- **Scope**: `easel chat` (terminal chat) only. **The Web workspace is unaffected.**
- **Symptom**: After the Agent raises an `ask_user` prompt and you answer it, the Agent's next reply may be rendered twice in the terminal (the content is correct — it just shows up twice).
- **Nature**: This is a **display-only** issue. It does not affect the actual conversation content, asset generation, or publishing results.

### Root cause

The issue lives in the **session projection** logic of upstream [OpenClaw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openclaw), not in the Easel repository.

`easel chat` runs `openclaw tui` under the hood, and OpenClaw's gateway-client rebuilds the transcript in the terminal. When a live reply is mistakenly matched against another row (e.g. the `ask_user` prompt row) and the two do not share a transcript identity, the projection re-inserts the reply, causing the duplicate render.

We verified this root cause and reproduced it in upstream regression tests (3 related cases failed before the fix and all pass after it).

### Upstream fix status

The fix has been submitted to OpenClaw. Tracking PRs:

- openclaw#144730
- openclaw#144892

The fix uses a four-layer strategy: unique full-content match, required terminal evidence, a tentative recovery record, and keeping a distinct later final visible when tentative recovery cannot represent it.

### Workaround and upgrade

- **Recommended**: use the **Web workspace** (`easel web`, `http://localhost:7870` by default). The Web backend renders from the raw event stream itself and does not go through the session-projection logic above, so it is **unaffected** by this issue — and it offers a more complete experience (conversations, assets, accounts, profiles, content library, and publishing management) than the CLI.
- If you prefer `easel chat`: once upstream ships a release with the fix, upgrading OpenClaw resolves it:

  ```bash
  npm i -g openclaw@latest
  ```

- Easel installs the OpenClaw global CLI (a prebuilt artifact), so we **do not vendor the patch inside the Easel repo**; instead we track the latest upstream release, and we plan to add an OpenClaw minimum-version check to `easel doctor`.
